          The TOROT Treebank is a dependency treebank with
          morphosyntactic and information-structure annotation. It includes a large collection of
          texts in Old Church Slavonic, Old East Slavonic and Middle Russian and is freely
          available under a <a

          The treebank is an expansion of the Slavonic part of the <a
          href="http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/proiel/">PROIEL corpus</a> 
          and was started as part of the research
          project <a
          href="https://uit.no/forskning/forskningsgrupper/sub?p_document_id=344365&sub_id=344451">Birds and Beasts: Shaping Events in Old Russian</a>, 
          which was financed by the
          Norwegian Research Council. The treebank is still in active
          development.
